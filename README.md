# Python from Scratch

These files are lessons and training exercises that are created as part of the Centrica Python from Scratch ad-hoc course.

There will (eventually) be some structure here.

## Keep up to date
This is a git repository.  To take a copy:

```
git clone https://github.com/ccdale/pythonfromscratch.git
```

That command will create the `pythonfromscratch` directory.

To keep your copy up to date with mine:

```
# change into the directory
# linxux/osx use cd
# windows use chdir (I think)
cd pythonfromscratch
git pull
```
